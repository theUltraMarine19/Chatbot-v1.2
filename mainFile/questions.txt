answer:Do not scrub like a manual toothbrush. Move the brush head slowly and gently across the teeth in a small back and forth motion so the longer bristles reach between your teeth. Apply light pressure to maximize Sonicares effectiveness and let the Sonicare do the brushing for you. The Sonicare may feel ticklish upon first use. To help you ease into the Sonicare experience you can use the easy-start feature.
